# Introduction

This project focuses on the development of a comprehensive mobile application designed to streamline the process of trip planning and sharing. 
The app allows users to organize various aspects of their travels, such as flight details, accommodations, activities, and itineraries, into a single, unified platform. 
It aims to equip users with a seamless experience through trip visualization, collaborative sharing features, and robust security measures, including end-to-end encryption for data protection.
