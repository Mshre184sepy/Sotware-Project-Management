## 1. Introduction

This project focuses on the development of a comprehensive mobile application designed to streamline the process of trip planning and sharing. 
The app allows users to organize various aspects of their travels, such as flight details, accommodations, activities, and itineraries, into a single, unified platform. 
It aims to equip users with a seamless experience through trip visualization, collaborative sharing features, and robust security measures, including end-to-end encryption for data protection.


## 2. Overview 
The primary goal of this mobile application is to improve the efficiency and user-friendliness of travel planning. 
By concentrating on travel-related information and facilitating easy collaboration, the app aims to:

1. Empower users to manage travel plans and bookings within a single platform.
2. Offer a collaborative space for sharing itineraries with friends and family.
3. Permit for real-time collaboration through editable trip plans.
4. Secure users' data through encryption during storage and transmission.
5. Support multiple languages to cater to a diverse, global user base.



## 3. Milstones 
1. The list of technology choices is specified and finalized for the database (Firebase, MongoDB), back-end (Node.js, Django), front-end (React, JavaScript, HTML), and hosting.
2. A development environment is used to test a few static test screens once the front end and back end of the program have been configured.
3. The app's template for sharing travel schedules and itineraries with others is integrated and functionally tested.
4. The program is built and tested so that users may plan and view the specifics of their trips, including dates and locations.
5. A mechanism for scheduling pick-up times and journeys with friends or groups is created and tested to guarantee seamless cooperation.
6. A tool is being created and tested for interaction with calendar services and alerts, which will allow users to select times for important events in their agenda, such as flights, excursions, and bookings.
7. The completion of location-based service integration, such as the Google Maps API, enables users to browse and add places to their travel itinerary. tested for accuracy, performance, and usefulness.
8. To guarantee that customers receive timely notices, push notifications and reminders for forthcoming travels or itinerary modifications are put into place and tested.
9. Before being released, the app is put through a rigorous testing process and performance improvements (such as loading speeds and offline access) to guarantee a seamless user experience.
10. Features for managing profiles, registering users, and logging in are put into practice and evaluated. Security precautions including social media login choices and password hashing are also examined.

## 7. Risks, Assumptions, and Constraints

## 7.1 Risks
1. Problems with hosting services or connecting with other services like Google Maps could make the app unavailable or not work properly.
2. Security issues could happen, like someone accessing user data without permission.
3. There might be challenges in building features like real-time collaboration or offline access, which could delay the project.
4. Users may find it hard to use the app, especially if they are used to other trip-planning tools.
5. Unexpected costs for services or scaling the app could go over the planned budget.


## 7.2 Risk Evaluation Chart


## 7.2 Assumptions
1. Other services like Google Maps will work reliably with little downtime.
2. Users will have good internet access to use real-time and collaborative features.
3. Users will provide correct and timely information for their trips.
4. The app will be used by people from different countries, so it will need to support multiple languages.


## 7.3 Constraints
1. The budget might limit what we can build, especially for advanced features like real-time collaboration.
2. The app must work well on both iOS and Android devices without performance issues.
3. The app should provide a seamless experience across different screen sizes (mobile, tablet) and network conditions.
